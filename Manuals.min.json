The tape","wraps around.","'I' refers to the value of the currently selected tile.","'P' refers to the currently selected tile's index (0 to 9).","'T ' refers to the value of the tile at index (x % 10).

Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he","were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole","administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole","mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was","an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an","undoubted bargain. The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started","from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or","nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly","convinced that Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more","remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,","than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in","a breezy spot -- say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance -- literally to astonish his","son's weak mind.","Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the","warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes","people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered","to both names. It was all the same to him.","Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone, Scrooge! A squeezing, wrenching,","grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which","no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an","oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled","his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue and spoke out shrewdly","in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry","chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the","dogdays; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.","External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry","weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more","intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know","where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the","advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down' handsomely, and Scrooge","never did. Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, `My dear","Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?'

For any real value m:","m(a + bi + cj + dk) = ma + (mb)i + (mc)j + (md)k","Multiplication is a bit tricker, as multiplication under quaternions is not","commutative; that is, q q does not necessarily equal q q . Multiplication of","fundamental quaternion units works as follows:","i  = j  = k  = -1 ij = k jk = i ki = j ji = -k kj = -i ik = -j","The product of two quaternions (a  + b i + c j + d k)(a  + b i + c j + d k) can then be","computed by expanding this expression using the distributive property,","multiplying units, and combining like terms. More explicitly, the product is:","(a a  - b b  - c c  - d d ) ","+ (a b  + b a  + c d  - d c )i","+ (a c  - b d  + c a  + d b )j","+ (a d  + b c  - c b  + d a )k","The conjugate of a quaternion q = a + bi + cj + dk, denoted q*, is a - bi - cj - dk.","The norm of a quaternion q = a + bi + cj + dk, denoted |q|, is sqrt(a  + b  + c  + d ).","Norms satisfy the relation |q |·|q | = |q q | for any two quaternions q , q .","Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Mod Quaternions","1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2","1 2 2 1","2 2 2","1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2","1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2","1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2","1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2","1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2","2 2 2 2","1 2 1 2 1 2"]}],"Modified":"2021-07-18 9:14:36 PM"},{"ID":"Quaver","Name":"Quaver","Pages":[{"Name":"Quaver_pg1","Text":["/","On the Subject of Quaver","Now set to permanent NLN!

Each","operation compares two binary numbers, resulting in a new one.","Operation Basics","The first step when working with boolean operators is to convert the two","provided parameters into binary form. Each 1 in a binary number, or bit,","represents a certain value. The last one equals 1, the one before 2, the one before","that 4. The values of each preceding number is double the value of the next.","Therefore, 127 equals 1111111, 3 equals 11, and 25 equals 11001. When two values","have different lengths, add as many zeros in front of that number until they do","have the same size. This means that 00001010 and 1010 are the same value.","AND-Operations","An AND-operation compares each individual bit in a binary number and outputs a","1 if both bits are a 1 as well. This means that an AND-operation with the values","1010 and 1101 outputs the value 1000, or the decimal value 8.","OR-Operations","An OR-operation compares each individual bit and outputs a 1 if either of the","two is or both are a 1. This means that an OR-operation with the values 1000 and","0011 outputs the value 1011, or the decimal value 11.","NAND-Operations","A NAND-operation compares each individual bit and only outputs a 1 if not both","of the bits are a 1. This means that a NAND-operation with values 0101 and 0111","outputs the value 1010, or the decimal value 10.","NOR-Operations","A NOR-operation is the inverse of an OR-operation and outputs a 1 if none of the","bits are a 1. This means that a NOR-operation with the values 1100 and 1001","outputs the value 0010, or the decimal value 2.","XOR-Operations","An XOR-operation is an OR-operation, however, also outputs a 0 if both values","are a 1. This means that an XOR-operation with the values 0110 and 1100 outputs","the value 1010, or the decimal value 10.","Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Mod Boolean Operations"]}],"Modified":"2021-07-18 9:25:22 PM"},{"ID":"Telepathy","Name":"Telepathy","Pages":[{"Name":"Telepathy_pg1","Text":["/","On the Subject of Telepathy","You already knew what this flavor text was.","You and the computer within the module are facing off, head￾to-head in a game of Telepathy.
